# odin-recipes
This is the first project I'll be making for The Odin Project Curriculum: a recipes website. 

I'll be using only HTML in this first step of the project, although if I'm not wrong I'll style it once I learn the CSS fundamentals. 

The HTML part will consist mainly in creating an index.html file for the main page where I'll be linking different recipes.
