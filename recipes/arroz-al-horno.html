    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <p>
        Arroz al horno, in English oven-baked rice, is a dish full of flavour that also looks great on the plate. The ingredients 
        vary, but generally it always contains cured meats, pork ribs and pancetta, as well as tomatoes, garlic, chickpeas and, of 
        course, Valencia Designation of Origin rice.
    </p>

    <p>
        Back in the day, the name of this dish was "arròs passejat" in Valencian language, meaning “gone-for-a-walk rice” in English,
        as once the first steps of the recipe were done, locals would take their traditional terracotta dishes full to the brim to 
        the nearest communal oven or bakery as not everybody had a home oven back then. Imagine the delectable aromas that would 
        have filled the streets in those days.
