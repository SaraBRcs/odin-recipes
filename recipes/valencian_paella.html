    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <p>
        Valencian Paella is the symbol and most internationally renowned dish of Valencia. It is the perfect way to gather friends and 
        family together, and cooking it is a ritual. The guests usually stay in the kitchen and chat with the cook while they wait 
        until everything is ready.

    <p>
        The main ingredientes and method are always the same, though there can be some slight variations depending on the season and
        the cook's personal preferences.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <p>The most popular ingredients for Valencian Paella are the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>500g of Valencia Designation of Origin rice.</li>

        <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>

        <li>Salt</li>

        <li>1 chopped rabbit</li>

        <li>1/2 chopped free-range chicken</li>

        <li>250g of flat green beans</li>

        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>

        <li>Paprika</li>

        <li>3-4 grated ripe tomatoes</li>

        <li>150g of Garrofó (another type of bean)</li>

        <li>Infused Saffron</li>

        <li>1 rosemary sprig (optional)</li>

        <li>4L of water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Browning the Meat to Build the Flavor Base</h3>

            <p>In the paella pan, heat a <strong>generous drizzle</strong> of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken and rabbit. Let them brown slowly until they are <strong>deeply seared</strong> on all sides. This step is essential for the dish's depth of flavor.</p>

            <p><strong>Do not stir constantly</strong>. Allow that golden crust to form, as it will later melt into the broth. This is one of the secrets to achieving a good paella.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Sautéing the Green Beans and Preparing the Sofrito</h3> 
            <!-- I should style all the Sofritos and literal Spanish words using CSS to change the font to italic -->

            <p>Once the meat is browned, add the <strong>250g of green beans</strong> and sauté them with the meat for a couple of minutes. Once they have softened slightly, <strong>push everything toward the edges</strong> of the paella pan to clear a space in the center.</p>

            <p>In that central space, <strong>add the minced garlic and sweet paprika</strong>. Lower the heat to prevent them from burning, and then immediately stir in the <strong>grated tomatoes</strong>. Cook until the sofrito has reduced and developed a deep, dark color and a thick, rich consistency.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Simmering the Broth to Integrate Flavors</h3>

            <p>Once the tomato has fully reduced, <strong>add 2 liters of water and the garrofó beans</strong>. Mark the liquid level—using a magnet or a spoon—so you can later identify the perfect cooking point for the rice. <strong>Add 2 more liters of water</strong> and let everything simmer for about 20 minutes.</p>

            <p>During this process, the broth will <strong>gain body</strong> as it absorbs the flavors of the meat, vegetables, and sofrito. This is the ideal moment to adjust the salt if needed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Adding the Saffron Infusion at Just the Right Time</h3>

            <p>Once the broth has reduced to the <strong>marked level</strong>, stir in the saffron infusion. This is the perfect moment for its flavor and color to meld without boiling away. You'll see the broth begin to take on that <strong>unmistakable golden hue</strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Cooking the Rice to Perfection</h3>

            <p>Add the 500g of Valencia Designation of Origin <strong>short-grain rice</strong> in a <strong>cross shape</strong> and spread it evenly </strong>without stirring</strong>. Cook over <strong>high heat for the first 8 minutes</strong>, then <strong>lower the heat for the final 7 minutes</strong>. <strong>Do not stir</strong> at any point to allow the traditional <strong>"socarrat"</strong> to form.</p>

            <p>The rice should be dry, perfectly cooked, and have a <strong>slightly crispy bottom layer</strong>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Resting and Serving</h3>

            <p>Once cooking is finished, <strong>remove the paella pan from the heat</strong> and <strong>cover it with a clean cloth for 5 to 10 minutes</strong>. This brief rest is <strong>key for the rice to finish settling</strong>, allowing the flavors to fully meld and the texture to reach its ideal point.</p>

            <p>Serve the paella <strong>directly in the pan</strong>, placing it in the center of the table to share. Garnish with <strong>lemon wedges</strong> if you like, and enjoy the <strong>inviting aroma</strong> of this traditional dish.</p>
